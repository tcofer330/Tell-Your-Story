# Tell-Your-Story
Join me to unite the world !

Overview

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. So, let us tell that story? Tell Your Story is a serverless application that enables users to upload, process, and vote on weekly photos from all around the world. With so much hate and division amongst us, I wanted to create a project that reminds us of how similar our everyday lives can be. The top photo of the month will receive a $10 reward. The solution leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) managed services for scalability and efficiency.

Architecture

- S3 for photo storage
- API Gateway for API management
- AWS Lambda for processing uploads and votes
- DynamoDB for storing metadata and votes
- CloudFront for optimized content delivery
- Rekognition for image analysis
- Cognito for user management
  
Benefits

• Serverless architecture reduces infrastructure management
• Auto-scaling to meet traffic spikes
• Integrated AI/ML for photo recognition
• Secure and seamless authentication
• Global content delivery with CloudFront
